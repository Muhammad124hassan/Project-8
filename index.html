    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <article>
        <p>Javascript is a cross platform, object oriented scripting language 
     .It is a small and light weight language.Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
     Javascript can be connected to objects of it's environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
     <p>Javascript contains a standard library of objects,such as array.Date, and math and a core set of 
 language elements such as operators, controls structure and statements.Core Javascript
 can be extended for a verify of a purposes by supplementing it with additional objects, for example</p>
 <ul>
    <li>
        Client side javascript extends the core language by supply objects to control
 a browser and its Document Object Mode.For example, client-side extensions allow an applications 
     elements on an HTML form and respond to user event such clicks ,form inputs, and page navigation. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Client side javascript extends the core language by supply objects to control
 a browser and its Document Object Mode.
For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communication database, provide
 continuity of information from one invent another of the applicatio, or perform file manipulations server.
    </li>

        <P>This guide assumes you have the following basic background</P>
        <ul>
            <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the world Wide (WWW).</li>
            <li>Good working knowledge of Hypertext markup language (HTML)</li>
            <li>Some programming experience
 .If you are new to programming one of the tutorials lined on the main page about javascript </li>

<section id="Javascript_and_Java">
    <h2>Javascript and Java</h2>
<article>
    <p>Javascript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamental different in some others.the javascript language resembles
 does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking Javascript follows most Java expression syntax naming
 convert and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why renamed from livescriptto Javascript</p>
    <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built declarations,Javascripts
     supports a runtime system based or number of data types representing numerics ,Boolean, and strong values. 
    Javascript has a prototype-based object model instead more common class-based object model.The prototype-based
     provides dynamics inheritance;that is,what is inherited for individual objects .Javascript also support functions
     any special declarative requirements. Function can be proper objects,executing as loosely type methods. </p>
    <p>Javascript is a very free form language compared to Java. You have to declare all
     variables,classes, and methods. You do to be concerned with whether methods are public, private and protected,
 and you do not have to implement interfaces.VAN parameters, and function return types are not explicity type. </p>

<section id="Hello_world">
    <h2>Hello world</h2>
    <article>
        To get started with writing Javascript, Open the scratchpad and your first "Hello world" Javascript code:
        <code>
            >function greetMe(Your Name) {Alert ("Hello" + YourName); }
            greetMe("World");
        </code>
        Select the code in the padand hit Ctrl+R to watch in unfold browser!
    </article>

<section id="Variables">
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <article>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your applications.
            The name of variables, called identifiers confirm to certain rules</p>
 <p>
Javascript identifiers must start with a letter. Underscore dollar sign subsequents characters can also be digits. Because Javascript
 is case sensitive,letters includes the word "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through (lowercase).
 </p>           
 <p>
    Yu can use ISO 8859-1 or unicodes letters such as a u and j identifiers.You can also use the unicode
     escape sequences characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
